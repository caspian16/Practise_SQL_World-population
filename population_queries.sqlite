-- This is the first query:

SELECT DISTINCT year from population_years;

-- Add your additional queries below:
SELECT MAX(population) FROM population_years WHERE country = 'Gabon';
SELECT country FROM population_years WHERE year = 2005 order by population ASC LIMIT 10;
SELECT DISTINCT country FROM population_years WHERE year = 2010 and population >100 ORDER BY population DESC;
SELECT count (country) as 'countries named Islands' from population_years WHERE country LIKE "%Islands%";
SELECT population from population_years Where year =2010 AND country ='Indonesia';
SELECT population from population_years Where year =2000 AND country ='Indonesia';
/* need to figure out how to concatenate two numerical results in the last query and add or subtract them*/
