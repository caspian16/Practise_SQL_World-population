Project Requirements
2.In this project, you’ll answer questions using a database of world population by country.
The schema of the database is:
Column	Type	Notes
country	STRING	
population	NUMBER	(in millions)
year	NUMBER	
Refer to this schema as you write queries to the database.

When you finish this project, you should be able to answer each the questions that follow using a single SQL query.

3.The first query has already been written for you to answer the following question:
What years are covered by the dataset? (you can manually count the number of years returned).
Continue adding your queries below the first one as you proceed.

4.What is the largest population size for Gabon in this dataset?

5.What were the 10 lowest population countries in 2005?

6.What are all the distinct countries with a population of over 100 million in the year 2010?

7.How many countries in this dataset have the word “Islands” in their name?

8.What is the difference in population between 2000 and 2010 in Indonesia?

Note: it’s okay to figure out the difference by hand after pulling the correct data.
